## SCC Title Screen - An RPG Maker VX Ace Script

Coming soon!

### About

The purpose of this script is to create the animated title screen, which is used in the game "Stray Cat Crossing". All assets for the game including the title screen were created by Jurlo. This script is heavily based off of Moghunter's title screen script. Scripts for RPG Maker VX Ace are in Ruby (RGSS3).

Feel free to use and modify this script, and please credit me and Moghunter if you do.

### Instructions

#### Viewing the script

To view the script, look in scc-title-screen.rb located in this repository.

Alternatively, you can find the script inside the demo by opening the demo's scripts and scrolling down to `SCC Title Screen`.

#### Viewing the script

To view the demo, extract the `scc-title-screen.zip` file from this repository and run the `Game.exe` application.

#### Viewing the script

To add the script to your game, paste the script below Materials and above Main. This is also where the script is in the included demo.

Note: This script only works with the assets included in the Demo. This purpose of sharing this script is not so other game will have the same title screen, but so that other RPG Maker game developers can use this as an example to learn from.
