## Minimalist Name Input - An RPG Maker VX Ace script

### About

The purpose of this script is to provide a simpler interface for inputting actor names and passwords in RPG Maker VX Ace, as the current interface contains too many characters that are unlikely to be necessary. Scripts for RPG Maker VX Ace are in Ruby (RGSS3).

Feel free to use and modify this script, and please credit me if you do.

### Instructions

#### Viewing the Script
To view the script, look in `minimalist-name-input.txt` located in this repository.

Alternatively, you can find the script inside the demo by opening up the demo's scripts and scrolling down to `Minimalist Name Input`.

#### Viewing the Demo

To view the demo, extract the `minimalist-name-input.zip` file from this repository and run the `Game.exe` application.

#### Using the Script

To add the script to your game, paste the script below Materials and above Main. This is also where the script is in the included demo. After doing this, whenever you run the event `Name Input Processing...`, the new interface should appear instead of the default one.

Note: This script works best for names/passwords up to 8 letters long. Any longer than 8 letters results in incorrect positioning due to the width of the name input window. In a future patch, I may try to make the window width dependent on the length of the name/password. For now, use shorter names/passwords!
